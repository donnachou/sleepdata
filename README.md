# SLEEP DATA ANALYSIS 
A data-driven analysis of sleep patterns among adults (ages 20-50) using Python libraries and a Kaggle dataset. This project explores factors influencing sleep quality, including age, gender, and physical activity levels, to reveal insights on optimal sleep habits.

## Key Features

Data Source: Kaggle

Analysis Environment: Google Colab

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Insights: Trends in sleep quality by age and gender, activity's impact on rest, and optimal bedtime/wake-up patterns


This project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization, making it ideal for learning data analysis workflows and understanding sleep quality determinants.
